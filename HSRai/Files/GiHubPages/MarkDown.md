There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header (the largest, bigger one, normaly used for title). We need to use `# <and one space>Title`
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

The above three will nor rendered as separate 3 lines, but produces one single paragraph.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.
>
> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor. `##` Used for Major heading. 

### Header 3

`###` used for sub-heading.

Single backtick (`) is used to write some coding part withing a paragraph. It is is also
known as backquote, grave, or grave accent.

Longer code (multiple lise) is enclosed within triple backtick, and `computer language` is written after the
opening triple backticks. Like `js` for `Javascript`.

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

Another way:

### Here is an unordered list:

* Item foo
* Item bar
* Item baz
* Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1. Red
1. Green
1. Blue
1. Black

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Text can be _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

```
The final element.
