## Tom Tom Api is used for Location based applications. it provide 6 different products to make our application.

1. Map API Make static and interactive maps and web apps
1. Traffic API = Flow details of traffic jams. Incidents on road.
1. search API = Search for address or place. Query Interface
4. Routing API = plans our route from ato b. (under real time traffic conditions)
5. Geofencing API - manage thousands of beautifyl boundariesfrom one location, fence management, fence reports
6. maps sdk = for android , ios, web

## All the reference videos that will help us to make our location based application

# Traffic API:
Related to traffic. The Traffic API is service designed for developers to create web and mobile applications around real-time traffic. These web services can be used via RESTful APIs.
##In traffic API we consider two API:
1. Traffic incident Api = It give us event happening on road . As a service API, it can be used to fetch events in a bounded box(an area in a map). It is also used by SDK to display incidents.This provides an accurate view about traffic jams and incidents around a road network.
2. Traffic flow API = this give how fast  or slow are street segments doing(eg = how traffic is going slow or fast) . This provides real time observed speeds and travel times for all key roads in a network.
## Using Tom Tom predict traffic flow:
Step 1: Add map to website :Add a map to your website =[https://youtu.be/rqpZFsM7vII](https://youtu.be/rqpZFsM7vII).
Step 2: Add traffic flow and incident layer to map. =[https://youtu.be/OKwF-F7LJPw](https://youtu.be/OKwF-F7LJPw).
Adding more, we can make route app with tom tom.
